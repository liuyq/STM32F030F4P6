derived from blinker01, using whatever clock it comes up with.

The cortex-m0 has a systick timer built in.  This example is counting
to 50Million clocks then toggling the led.  It changes state every 6
seconds give or take.  Basically it appears this is an 8Mhz clock.
50000000/80000000 = 6.25 seconds.

There is an HSI8 (internal rc based) clock in this chip, so this must
be the one being used.
