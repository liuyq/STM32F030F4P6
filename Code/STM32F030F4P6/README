Bought some more ebay boards.  Search for STM32F030F4P6, come with
two sets of four pin connectors at the bottom, one is for serial the
other for SWD.  I assume it is a bad idea if you use the usb power
and the power at the other end at the same time.

This is essentially the same chip as the DWSTM32 example, more
flash or ram.
